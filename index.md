## Keeghens car accident

### My experience
  I was in our family car when we were hit by a car while crossing an intersection.  We were all taken to the hospital.  I had glass in my forehead from the car window.  They put a neck brace on me to make sure my neck was OK.  The nurse took pieces of glass out of my forehead and the doctor stitched up my head.  Other than that I was perfectly fine.

### little sisters experience
  My little sister as well was there.  And she got hit by glass at her lip,cheek, and on top of her eyebrow. In the hospital she through up and my mom was woried. Then my dad and I went to see my sister and mom I got to talk to mom and git to eat some fruit. I think she got a little concussion but she was fine.

### Going Home
  We were at home and no one was there because everyone was at school and work. So, to pass the time I biult the legos I got from the hospital. It was a Pirate's of the Carrabean Lego(r) set.  It took me about 2 minutes to put together.  It was a very small and simple set.  The next day we got ice cream.
