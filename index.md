## Keeghens car accident

I was in our family car when we were hit by a car while crossing an intersection.  We were all taken to the hospital.  I had glass in my forehead from the car window.  They put a neck brace on me to make sure my neck was OK.  The nurse took pieces of glass out of my forehead and the doctor stitched up my head.  Other than that I was perfectly fine.

My little sister as well was there.
